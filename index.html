                <h2>A little about me</h2>

                <p>I grew up in Mt. Juliet, TN, but have lived out of the state since 
                  2005. I moved to Sioux Falls, SD for school and stayed there until 2011, 
                  when I was offered a job roasting coffee for Stumptown in Seattle. In 
                  2014 I moved to Chicago, and stayed there until 2017, when my wife and I 
                  moved to South Florida. We'll be moving back to the Nashville area at the 
                  end of June.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Working with mostly smaller companies I have always ended up wearing a lot 
                  of different hats at work, and more than once ended being responsible for 
                  maintaining a website and/or online store. With everything going on in the 
                  world right now the coffee company I was running had to shut down, which turned 
                  out to be just the push I needed to actually pursue web design and coding. Looking 
                  forward to learning some new stuff over the next few months. 
                </p>
