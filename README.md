A simple about me page to practice implementing some of the skills from bootcamp

## Roadmap
Update the fonts to something more interesting.
update color scheme and overall visual appeal. 
Planning on adding content as I go.

## Contributing
Suggestions are welcome, but I would prefer to make the changes myself as it helps me learn the proper coding and technique.
